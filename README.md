# thyme
Hi, this is hans. I am adding a readme because no one else has yet. So, here it is.
Thyme was adam's idea for a vine alternative. 
If you have been living under a rock for the past few months, Vine has shut down and stuff.
Adam decided to make an alternative for profit. 

If anyone has anything to add, please do.
